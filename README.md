# LSTM_WebIntegration
### Long Short-Term Memory Project
LSTM is a special type of recurrent neural network used to learn patterns in sequential data. 

### Interface Preview 
Here is a screenshot of the application ran locally:

The interface allows users to enter a sequence of number separated by comma and see the predictions. When given input as 0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4 and 0.5, the model predict that the next value in the sequence is 0.32117.
